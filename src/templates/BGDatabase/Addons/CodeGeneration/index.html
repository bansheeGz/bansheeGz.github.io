<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Code Generation makes already pretty easy BGDatabase API even easier.
    If you use this addon- database will use generated classes instead of basic BGEntity while populating table rows.
    Each generated class defines additional properties to access the data.
</p>
<p>
    Here is an example: lets assume you have a table named "MyTable" which has one single field: intField of type int.
</p>
<p>
    To access it without CodeGen you would use something like this:
    <code>
        var intValue = entity.Get&lt;int&gt;("intField");
    </code>
</p>
<p>
    As you can see, you should provide field name and field type.
</p>

<p>
    With CodeGen you would use something like this
    <code>
        var intValue = entity.intField;
    </code>
</p>
<p>
    So all fields with their types will be generated for you for maximum ease of use.
</p>

<p>
    The only drawback CodeGen has- you need to regenerate the classes each time you change database structure (e.g. adding/removing tables or fields)
</p>

<table class="contentTable">
    <tr>
        <th>
            Parameter name
        </th>
        <th>
            Description
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Code Generator</td>
        <td>Class to use for code generation. You can leave the default one, if you do not need any customization</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Source file</td>
        <td>Source file to use for generated classes. All classes will be put into one single .cs file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Package</td>
        <td>Package for generated classes. For example (BansheeGz.BGDatabase.Example)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Class names prefix</td>
        <td>Prefix to use for each class. So if you use BGE_ prefix, the final class for "MyTable" table will be named BGE_MyTable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Field names prefix</td>
        <td>Prefix to use for each generated property. So if you use f_ prefix, the final class for "name" field will be named f_name</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Entities prefix</td>
        <td>[Optional] Optionally, you can generate properties for each entity.
            After that, you can access each entity directly using these properties.
