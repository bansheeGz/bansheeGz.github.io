#set page=Save Load

<p>
    Save/Load addon enable you to save/load the state of the database to/from byte array.
    You can define which table and which fields you want to be saved/loaded.
    You can find <code>Save Load</code> addon under <code>Addons->Save Load</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Generally speaking, you want as less data to be saved as possible.
    You do not need to include data, that is "static" and can not be changed during play session.
</p>

<p>
    The rules are very simple:
<ol>
    <li>
        If you have some field, which value can be changed during the play session and you want this change to be
        persistent,
        you need to mark this field to be included to save/load.
        Example from our example scenes: we want the amount of gold, player gathered to be remembered between game
        sessions-
        so we marked this field to be saved and loaded.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have some table, whose rows can be changed during gameplay and you want these changes to be remembered,
        you need to mark this table to be included to the save/load by setting following setting to true:
        "Add missing", "Remove Orphaned", "Update matching".
        These setting will ensure, that all rows from this table will be saved and loaded.
        Example from our example scenes: Collectable table rows can be changed, so we marked them as described above.
    </li>
</ol>
