#set page=Minify add-on

<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>This is work-in-process, expected to be release in version 1.8.18</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    "Minify" add-on removes selected tables or fields from the database file included in the build.
    This add-on activates during the player build start event, removing selected tables and fields,
    and subsequently restores the full database upon the build completion event.

<h4>Important note</h4>
<p>
    If an unexpected event occurs during the build process, such as a crash or power outage, you may end up with an
    incomplete/minified database.
    In this case, you need to check if database is minified and restore it from either <a href="../../Misc/LocalBackups">local backup folder</a> or from
    temp folder, created by minify addon. You can find temp folder location under "Misc" tab

<h4>Detecting accidental access to removed tables or fields</h4>
<p>
    If you want to detect accidental access to disabled tables and fields in runtime, toggle on "Emulate build runtime in play mode" parameter.
    Once you enter play mode in Unity Editor, disabled tables/fields will be removed from database
