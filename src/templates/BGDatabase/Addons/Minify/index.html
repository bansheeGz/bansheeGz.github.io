#set page=Minify add-on

<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>This is work-in-process, expected to be release in version 1.8.18</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    "Minify" add-on removes selected tables or fields from the database file included in the build.
    This add-on activates during the player build start event, removing selected tables and fields,
    and subsequently restores the full database upon the build completion event.

<h4>Important note</h4>
<p>
    If an unexpected event occurs during the build process, such as a crash or power outage, you may end up with an
    incomplete/minified database.
    In this case, you need to check if database is minified and restore it from either <a href="../../Misc/LocalBackups">local backup folder</a> or from
    temp folder, created by minify addon. You can find temp folder location under "Misc" tab

<h4>Detecting accidental access to removed tables or fields</h4>
<p>
    When you are running your game in Unity Editor, you have access to the full database,
    so if you accidentally access table/fields, marked for exclusion, there will be no error.
    However, when you build and run your game outside of Unity Editor, an exception will be thrown,
    because tables or fields were removed from the database.
    Unfortunately, there is no way to detect such accidental access to excluded tables/fields if you use <a href="../../API">basic API</a>,
    but in case of <a href="../../CodeGeneration">code generation</a>, we can take some actions to detect such invalid access.
    The following actions available:
</p>
<table class="contentTable">
    <tr>
        <th>
            Name
        </th>
        <th>
            Description
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Skip Disabled</td>
        <td>no code will be generated for excluded tables/fields, so you won't be able to access them via generated classes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Surround with &#35;if UNITY_EDITOR</td>
        <td>code for excluded tables/fields will be surrounded with <code>UNITY_EDITOR</code> directive,
            so it works well inside Unity Editor, but if you accidentally access this code from runtime assembly, compilation error occurs
            during player build process. This option is effective for <a href="../../CodeGeneration/ExtensionClasses">extension classes</a> and
            <a href="../../CodeGeneration/MonoBehaviourClasses">MonoBehaviour classes</a> only.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Throw exception </td>
        <td>exception is thrown if you access excluded table or field during playmode is on</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Log warning</td>
        <td>warning is printed to the console if you access excluded table or field during playmode is on</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Log debug</td>
        <td>debug message is printed to the console if you access excluded table or field during playmode is on</td>
    </tr>
</table>
