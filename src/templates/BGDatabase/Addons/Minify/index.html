#set page=Minify add-on

<p class="redText">This is a work in progress and is anticipated to be included in the upcoming version (1.8.18).</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    "Minify" add-on removes selected tables or fields from the database file included in the build.
    This add-on activates during the player build start event, removing selected tables and fields,
    and subsequently restores the full database upon the build completion event.

<h4>Important note</h4>
<p>
    If an unexpected event occurs during the build process, such as a crash or power outage, you may end up with an
    incomplete/minified database.
    In this case, you need to check if database is minified and restore it from either <a href="../../Misc/LocalBackups">local backup folder</a> or from
    temp folder, created by minify addon. You can find temp folder location under "Misc" tab

<h4>Emulating runtime database in Unity Editor</h4>
<p>
    If you toggle "Emulate build runtime in play mode" parameter on, excluded tables/fields will be removed once you enter play mode in Editor
    and restored when play mode is stopped
