<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Live update let you update database data on player's devices using Google Sheets.
</p>
<h4>How it works</h4>
<ol>
    <li>First time your game is launched and database is loaded, it'll try to read data from Google Sheets</li>
    <li>If step 1 is successful, every time database is loaded, it will be merged with data from Google Sheets, thus
        applying the update.
    </li>
    <li>If step 1 is unsuccessful, database data will remain intact.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Setting up</h4>
<p>
    LiveUpdate addon uses public GoogleSheets Json API. It means your spreadsheet needs to be publicly available
    ("public" or "people with link" access levels). Also, you will need to fill in "Spreadsheet Id" and "API key"
    (Learn how to obtain them in Parameters table below)
</p>
<div>
    You can check if you set up config properly by accessing this address from your browser (make sure it returns valid
    json, not some error )
<p class="llink">
    https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/[Your Spreadsheet Id]/values/[Name of one of your metas]?key=[Your API key]</p>
For example, (SpreadsheetId=MYko0fxH01GIJcBq41YAT9eFpU6Znm5I5RByHsJpupHZ, ApiKey=WAIzaSyB0xsc_BoOBNRHfhW9xpCx1t03a-gV6qc and Meta=Items)
