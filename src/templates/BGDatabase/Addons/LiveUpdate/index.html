#set page=Live Update

<p>
    Live update let you update database data on player's devices using Google Sheets.
</p>
<p>
    This is how it works:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>First time your game is launched and database is loaded, it'll try to read data from Google Sheets</li>
    <li>If step 1 is successful, every time database is loaded, it will be merged with data from Google Sheets, thus applying the update.</li>
    <li>If step 1 is unsuccessful, database data will remain intact.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    LiveUpdate addon uses public GoogleSheets Json API. It means your spreadsheet need to be publicly available.
