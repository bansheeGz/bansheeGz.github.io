<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Multi-threading addon creates environment, which can be accessed from multiple threads safely.
</p>

<h4>What can I do with multi-threading addon?</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Chose which tables you want to be accessible in multithreaded environment. </li>
    <li>Merge changes from multithreaded environment back to main database either manually or on save event (before save takes place).
        This procedure is pretty expensive and should not be called often.
    </li>
    <li>Generate utility classes with it's own code generator</li>
    <li>Not all BGDatabase fields are available for multithreaded access. You can learn which fields are available <a href="../../Multithreading/">here</a>
        You can also see which fields are not supported in merge settings under "Merge" tab
    </li>
</ol>
