#set page=Lazy Load

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Lazy Load addon enables database lazy-loading.
    Tables will not be loaded until the moment any table data is queried.
    This can simplify development process, because you will not have to load database data every time Unity reload assemblies,
    i.e. every time you change your script or hit Play/Stop button.
    The actual loading will be delayed until the moment you need BGDatabase data, so there is a chance it will not be loaded at all.
