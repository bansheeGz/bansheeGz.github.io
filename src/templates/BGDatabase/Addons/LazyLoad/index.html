#set page=Lazy Load

<p>
    Lazy Load enable lazy-loading of database. Database will not be loaded until the moment you query it.
    This can greatly simplify development process, cause you will not have to load database data until the moment you need it.
    However we strongly advise you against using it for builds, cause lazy loading requires much more memory and actually slower if you want to load full database.
