#set page=Code Generation

Code Generation is a key element for simplifying access to database.
There are 2 main types of code generation, lets look at them.

<ol>
    <li>Extension classes</li>
    <li>MonoBehaviour Classes</li>
</ol>

<h4>Extension classes</h4>
<p>
    These classes are inherited from basic BGEntity.
    These classes can not be added to GameObject, cause they are not Unity's MonoBehaviour.
    When this CodeGen is enabled, database populated not with basic BGEntity objects, but with these extension classes.
    So when you access database like this <code>var entity=meta[0];</code> <code>entity</code> variable has this extension type,
    with all fields generated as properties.
</p>
<p>
    This CodeGen is embedded to database via Database addon, called CodeGeneration.
    After enabling this addon you will be able to generate these classes.
</p>
<p>
    Here is an example. Let's say you have a table called MyTable which has one field, called intField of type int.
    So the generated class will look like this
</p>
<pre class="cs">
public partial class BGE_MyTable : BGEntity
{
    public System.Int32 f_intField
	{
		get
		{
			return Get&lt;System.Int32&gt;("intField");
		}
		set
		{
			Set("intField", value);
		}
	}
}</pre>

<p>
    As you can see all boilerplate code will be generated, so you can simply use <code>entity.f_intField</code> to get or set value of type int
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, you will get all main table(meta) methods overridden as static methods of that particular class, like this:
</p>
<pre class="cs">
public static BGE_MyTable FindEntity(Predicate&lt;BGE_MyTable&gt; filter)
{
}
public static List&lt;BGE_MyTable&gt; FindEntities(Predicate&lt;BGE_MyTable&gt; filter)
{
}
public static void ForEachEntity(Action&lt;BGE_MyTable&gt; action, Predicate&lt;BGE_MyTable&gt; filter=null)
{
}
public static BGE_MyTable GetEntity(BGId entityId)
{
}
public static BGE_MyTable GetEntity(int index)
{
}
public static BGE_MyTable NewEntity()
{
}
</pre>
<p>
    so instead of doing this, for example:
</p>
<pre class="cs">
    var repo = BGRepo.I;
    var meta = repo["MyTable"];
    var entity = meta[new BGId("HThOdRCxlEGU1aefSG+Nbw")];
</pre>
    you can do this:
<pre class="cs">
    var entity = BGE_MyTable.GetEntity(new BGId("HThOdRCxlEGU1aefSG+Nbw"));
</pre>
<p>
    using generated <code>BGE_MyTable</code> class.
</p>


<h4>MonoBehaviour Classes</h4>
<p>
    Those classes are inherited from BGEntityGo, which in turn is inherited from Unity's MonoBehaviour.
    So these classes are Unity standard components and can be added to any GameObject in the Inspector.
    After that you can chose which row should be connected.
    So these classes are designed to be added to GameObject in the Inspector
</p>
<p>
    This CodeGen is embedded to database via Database addon, called CodeGeneration.
    After enabling this addon you will be able to generate these classes.
</p>
<p>
    This classes is not embedded to database and can be generated on Settings tab in the BGDatabase window
</p>
