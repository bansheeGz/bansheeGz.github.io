#set page=Code Generation

Code Generation is the key element for simplifying access to the database.
Code Generation is the process of producing C# source files using database structure/content as the source data.

    Here is the full list of code generation types:

    <li><a href="ExtensionClasses">Extension classes</a> (highly recommended)- classes (produced by CodeGen addon generator) to be used inside database instead of generic BGEntity class (GUI is under Addons->CodeGen)</li>
    <li><a href="MonoBehaviourClasses">MonoBehaviour Classes</a> - classes, which can be attached to GameObject (extended from MonoBehaviour) and pointing to a row (GUI is under Settings->MonoBehavior code generation)</li>o
    <li>Reference classes (optionally produced by CodeGen addon)- classes which can be used to reference database row from your own C# scripts (alternative to MonoBehaviour generated classes, GUI is under Addons->CodeGen)</li>
    <li><a href="../ThirdParty/Playmaker">Playmaker actions</a> - actions for Playmaker (GUI is under Settings->Playmaker)</li>
    <li><a href="../ThirdParty/Bolt">Unity Visual Scripting (ex-Bolt) units</a> - units for Unity Visual Scripting/Bolt (GUI is under Settings->Visual Scripting)</li>
