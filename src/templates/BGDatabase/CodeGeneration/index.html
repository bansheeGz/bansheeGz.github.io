#set page=Code Generation

Code Generation is a key element for simplifying access to database.
There are 2 main types of code generation, lets look at them.

<table class="contentTable">
    <tr>
        <th>
        </th>
        <th>
            Extension Classes
        </th>
        <th>
            MonoBehaviour Classes
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>When is used</td>
        <td>
            These classes are inherited from basic BGEntity.
            When CodeGen is enabled, database populated not with basic BGEntity objects, but with these extension classes.
            These classes can not be added to GameObject, cause they are not Unity's MonoBehaviour.
        </td>
        <td>
            Those classes are inherited from BGEntityGo, which in turn is inherited from Unity's MonoBehaviour.
            So these classes are Unity standard components and can be added to any GameObject in the Inspector.
            After that you can chose which row should be connected.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>How to enable</td>
        <td>
            This CodeGen is embedded to database via Database addon, called CodeGeneration.
            After enabling this addon you will be able to generate these classes.
        </td>
        <td>
            This classes is not embedded to database and can be generated on Settings tab in the BGDatabase window
        </td>
    </tr>
