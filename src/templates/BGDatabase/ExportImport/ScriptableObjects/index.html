<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Generate both scriptable object C# sources (one per table) and assets (one per row).
    Data synchronization with scriptable objects differs from other formats, please, read this guide to learn how it works and which limitations it has
</p>

<h4>Setup</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Read <a href="../Common">this guide</a> to learn how to create a data source and a job</li>
    <li>Switch to a data source and select a folder for C# source files for scriptable objects (use new, empty folder)
        and press on "Generate C# source files" button to generate C# sources for scriptable objects.
        One C# source file for each table will be generated.

            <a href="#path images/BGDatabase/SO3.png"><img style="width: 400px" src="#path images/BGDatabase/SO3.png"></a>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>Select a folder for scriptable object assets (use new, empty folder)</li>
    <li>Switch to a job and setup <a href="../MergeSettings">merge settings</a>.
        Be careful with "Remove orphaned" setting, because it can lead to rows or assets being deleted if no matching row or asset is found.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click on "Export" button to generate assets or "Import" button to transfer data from assets to database
        <div class="bg-image">
            <a href="#path images/BGDatabase/SO4.png"><img style="width: 400px" src="#path images/BGDatabase/SO4.png"></a>
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Warnings</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Select 2 new, empty folders for generated C# sources and scriptable assets. Do not put other assets in these folders.
    </li>
    <li>Exporting data while assets are not yet exist is very slow, exporting 1000 rows can take 20-25 seconds.
        Transferring data to existing assets or importing data is quite fast.
    </li>
    <li>Exporting data creates one asset(file) per each row, keep this in mind if you have a lot of rows</li>
    <li>If you want to create a new asset and import it later to the database by duplicating existing asset,
        make sure to clear <code>Id</code> field in duplicated asset, otherwise the asset will be ignored
    </li>
    <li>Though <a href="../MergeSettings">merge settings</a> are supported,
        we recommend to use data source settings to include/exclude tables/fields instead
    </li>
<!--
    <li>While importing (ScriptableObjects->database) is fast, exporting (database->ScriptableObjects) is very slow,
        even exporting 1000 rows can be very slow
    </li>
-->
    <li>When you use "Remove orphaned" toggle in <a href="../../ExportImport/MergeSettings">merge settings</a> during export,
        it means that orphaned scriptable assets will be physically deleted.
    </li>
    <li>See the job's log for more information about synchronization process</li>
    <li>Not all fields are supported (read the section below for more details).</li>
    <li>Read the guide below about how to change settings or table/field names safely</li>
</ol>

<h4>C# sources and assets</h4>
<p>
    Scriptable objects consist of two parts- C# source files for scriptable objects (with cs extension),
    which defines which fields each asset has and the assets, the instances of this C# class, stored in separate files (with asset extension).
    Both C# source files (one for each table) and the assets (one for each row) are generated.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Generating C# sources: C# sources can be generated from data source page. You can also exclude some
        tables/fields from generation
    </li>
    <li>Generating assets: assets are generated during export job execution.
        C# source files should be up-to-date,
        they should have all supported/included database fields, otherwise exception is thrown
        and C# source files generation should be run to update source files.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Unsupported fields</h4>
<p>
    Most of the fields, including assets and relations are supported.
    The following fields are excluded because they are not supported by Unity (hashtable, guid, ray, ray2D, listGuid, decimal, all nullable fields).
    The following fields rely on BGDatabase code and are also excluded (objectReference, objectListReference,
    objectListMultiValueReference, entityReference, entityReferenceList, id, action).
    If you exclude some table manually, all relational fields, referencing this table, are going to be excluded automatically.
</p>

<h4>How to change settings, table/field names</h4>
<p>
    If you change folders, class name prefix or table name without any further action, you are going to lose the link between database data and
    existing assets or create duplicates next time you export/import data.
    This section describes, how to update folders, class name prefix, table or field names without losing links with existing assets.
    [Important] Backup your project just in case before renaming
</p>
<h5>Changing folders</h5>
<p>
    After changing folders in the settings, move the folders manually inside Unity Editor to new location.
</p>

<h5>Changing classes name prefix</h5>
<p>
    After changing <code>Classes name prefix</code> in the settings, rename all generated C# source files inside Unity Editor to reflect the change,
    for example if your source file is <code>S_MyTable.cs</code>, and you change the prefix from <code>S_</code> to <code>T_</code> the new name should be
    <code>T_MyTable.cs</code>. After changing all file names, regenerate C# sources for scriptable objects and fix all compilation errors
    by changing class names from old name (<code>S_MyTable</code>) to new name (<code>T_MyTable</code>) in your C# code.
</p>

<h5>Renaming table name</h5>
<p>
    After renaming table name, rename both the C# source file name and folder name for generated assets inside Unity Editor to reflect the change.
    For example, if the old name is <code>MyTable</code> and the new table name is <code>MyTableUpdated</code> and <code>Classes name prefix</code> is <code>S_</code>,
    rename C# source file from <code>S_MyTable.cs</code> to <code>S_MyTableUpdated.cs</code> and folder name from <code>MyTable</code> to <code>MyTableUpdated</code>.
    After changing C# file name and folder name, regenerate C# sources for scriptable objects and fix all compilation errors
    by changing class name from old name (<code>S_MyTable</code>) to new name (<code>S_MyTableUpdated</code>) in your C# code.
</p>

<h5>Renaming field name</h5>
<p>
    if you want to change field name and then re-generate both C# sources and the assets, there is no need for extra actions.
    If you want to rename the field and regenerate C# sources without re-generating the assets,
    you need to add
    <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Serialization.FormerlySerializedAsAttribute.html">FormerlySerializedAs</a>
    attribute to the C# field with value, equal to the old name. After renaming database field, open data source page, then "C# settings",
    then create a custom settings for the table, include the table, open fields popup, create a custom setting for the field, include it and enter old field name to
    "FormerlySerializedAs" column. You can remove this setting after assets generating is executed.
