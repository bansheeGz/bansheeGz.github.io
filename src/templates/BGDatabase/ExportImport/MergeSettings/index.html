<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Merge settings define which tables/fields are included in data exchange</p>
<p>
    You have full control over which data you want to synchronize: you can toggle on add/delete/update operations and choose which
    tables/fields you wish to update.
</p>
<p>
    Here is how it works:
    Every synchronization has a source and a destination.
    If you are exporting data from BDDatabase to, let's say, Excel file - the source is BGDatabase and a destination- is
    Excel file.
    Here is how data is classified during syncing:
</p>
<div class="bg-image">
    <a href="#path images/BGDatabase/ExportImport2.png"><img style="width: 400px" src="#path images/BGDatabase/ExportImport2.png"></a>
</div>
<p>
    So, there are 3 types of rows during syncing:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Matching rows : they exist in the Source and in the Destination. Can be updated, and you can choose which fields
        to update.
    </li>
    <li>Missing rows : they exist only in the Source. Can be added to Destination.</li>
    <li>Orphaned rows : they exist only in the Destination. Can be removed from Destination.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Let's look at merge settings and find out how we can define actions to take during syncing
</p>
<div class="bg-image">
    <a href="#path images/BGDatabase/ExportImport3.png"><img style="width: 400px" src="#path images/BGDatabase/ExportImport3.png"></a>
</div>

<h4 id="rowlevel">Row-level control for merge settings</h4>
<p>Merge settings let you configure which table/fields you want to add/delete/update, but it does not give you the opportunity to define which rows you want to add/delete/update</p>
<p>For row-level control, you can implement C# controller class, which can cancel any operation if some condition is met. This is how:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create your own C# class with unique name, set this class name to "Controller Type" field of merge settings (using the full name with namespace).</li>
    <li>Implement any number of interfaces (namespace is <code>BansheeGz.BGDatabase</code>, interfaces defined inside class <code>BGMergeSettingsEntity</code>),
        listed below to receive callback method invocations. Return true from these methods to cancel operation</li>
</ul>

        <th width="40%">method(s) to implement</th>

        </td>
        <td>

        </td>
        <td>
            Callbacks to be called before updating the row' field. The same as <code>IUpdateMatchingReceiver</code>,
            but it's called on per field basis. <code>IUpdateMatchingReceiver</code> is called before this callback,
            and if <code>IUpdateMatchingReceiver</code> return true, this callback will never be invoked (cause updating entity will be cancelled by <code>IUpdateMatchingReceiver</code>)
        </td>

            Callback is called by <a href="../../Addons/SaveLoad">SaveLoad addon</a> while saving the data for each row.
            If this method returns true, the row is skipped and not included into saved data
