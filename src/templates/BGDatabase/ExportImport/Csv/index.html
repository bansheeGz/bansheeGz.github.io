<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The guide about importing and exporting data to CSV files</p>
<p>
    Current implementation of CSV files synchronization is very simplified compared to Excel/Google sheets synchronization,
    CSV files can only contain database data,
    "Update Ids on import" feature is not supported and many additional settings are not supported.
    During data exporting several CSV files are created (one per table)
