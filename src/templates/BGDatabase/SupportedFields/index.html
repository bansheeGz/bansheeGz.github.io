<h4 id="unityassets">Unity Asset Fields (#1)</h4>
<p>
    All these fields are read only.
    You can reference any Unity asset (UnityObject can be used to reference any asset).
    This reference will be resolved by a path.
    It means all unity asset fields store the path to an asset.
    There is 2 ways this path can be properly resolved:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Asset should be stored under Resources folder. This is very simple way to reference an asset.
        All you have to do is to place your asset under Resources folder
    </li>
    <li>
        Asset should be included in the asset bundle. This is super complicated way.
        To be properly resolved, asset bundle, the asset belongs to, should be properly loaded at the moment we try to query this field.
        Note, we do not manage asset bundles in any way.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="nested">Nested Field (#2)</h4>
<p>
    Nested field is a special field, which creates a whole new meta (table), which has many-to-one relation to owner meta.
    It means, you can create a linked list with any fields that are supported by BGDatabase.
    It is a readonly field (to change it's value- delete or add nested Entities)
</p>
<div class="bg-image">
    <a href="#path images/BGDatabase/SupportedFields1.png"><img style="width: 400px" src="#path images/BGDatabase/SupportedFields1.png"></a>
</div>

<h4 id="unityscene">Unity Scene Fields (#3)</h4>
<p>
    There are 2 ways to reference GameObject in the scene
</p>
<ol>
    <li>if this object has BGEntityGo component attached. BGEntityGo is used to reference a row from a database and you can use it's id to get reference to GameObject</li>
    <li>if this object has BGWithId component attached. BGWithId is simple component with generated id, you can use this id to get reference to GameObject</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Both methods use UnityObject.FindComponentOfType method and super slow.
