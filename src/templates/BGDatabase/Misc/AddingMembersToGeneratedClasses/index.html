<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    There is an easy way to add your own C# properties/methods to the classes, generated by <a href="../../Addons/CodeGeneration">CodeGen addon</a> or any other code generator.
    This can be very useful in many cases.
</p>

<h4>How to add</h4>
<p>
    You can not add your own code to the C# source file, which was used in CodeGen addon settings, because this file is rewritten every time the code is generated.
    So the solution is to create your own C# source file (the name does not matter, but do not give it a name of existing classes)
    and add the partial class with the same name/namespace as the generated one to this new
    C# source file. You can add as many classes as you want to this C# source file.
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Let's say we have a list of <code>Items</code> with <code>quantity</code> and <code>price</code>,
    and now we want to have a <code>sum</code> readonly property equals to quantity multiplied by price.
    If you need to see the <code>sum</code> value under database GUI, you can create <code>sum</code> calculated or programmable field
</p>

<p>
    however, if it's not a requirement, instead of creating <code>sum</code> field,
    you can simply add C# new property manually to generated class for <code>Items</code> table.
</p>
<p>
    Here is the CodeGen addon settings
</p>
<img src="#path images/BGDatabase/Misc28.png"/>
<p>
    We add GenExtension.cs file manually and add D_Items partial class to it and then add new <code>sum</code> property to it
</p>
<img src="#path images/BGDatabase/Misc29.png"/>
<p>
    Now we can use this new property just like any other properties.
</p>

<p>
    The same technique can be used to add any number of custom C# properties/methods to generated classes, which can be very useful in many cases.
    If you are looking for other example, download our <a href="../../Downloads/ExampleInventory">inventory project</a>, which uses this technique
