<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    You can run your own code before or after data export/import job is executed.
</p>

<h4>How to enable the feature</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Create a new C# class (let's say ExportImportJobListener, the name does not matter) under Editor assembly (under Editor folder)</li>
    <li>Add the following code to the top of your class <code>using BansheeGz.BGDatabase.Editor;</code></li>
    <li>Implement BGEditorJobStartedCallbackI interface if you want to run the code when a job is started</li>
    <li>Implement BGEditorJobCompletedCallbackI interface if you want to run the code when a job is completed</li>
    <li>Context object, which is passed to the methods, provides additional information about operation:
        the job's name, operation type (import or export) and for BGEditorJobCompletedCallbackI method,
        the context also has an error (if there was any error)
    </li>
    <li>See the example below for more details</li>
</ol>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
    The following script is executed when a job is started or completed.
    If you want to share some data between OnStarted and OnCompleted methods, use static fields,
    because there could be 2 different instances of ExportImportJobListener, one for each interface
</p>

<pre class="nomargin"><code class="language-csharp">using BansheeGz.BGDatabase.Editor;
using UnityEngine;

public class ExportImportJobListener : BGEditorJobStartedCallbackI, BGEditorJobCompletedCallbackI
{
    //BGEditorJobStartedCallbackI, called when a job is started (before execution)
    public void OnStarted(BGEditorJobStatusContext context)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Job [{context.JobName}] is started, operation [{context.Operation}]");
    }

    //BGEditorJobCompletedCallbackI, called when a job is finished
    public void OnCompleted(BGEditorJobCompletedContext context)
    {
        if (context.Error == null)
        {
            Debug.Log($"Job [{context.JobName}] is completed successfully, operation [{context.Operation}]");
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.Log($"Job [{context.JobName}] failed, the error is [{context.Error}]");
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

    Execution result
