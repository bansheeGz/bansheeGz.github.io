    Data validation allows to set the rules to validate data.
    Validation works in Unity Editor only and has no effect at runtime.
    To turn on validation, press on "Validation off" button at the top left of BGDatabase window.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Field is required</td>
        <td>Field should have some value. Only class-based fields are affected, cause struct-based fields always have a value</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Key is unique</td>
        <td>Each <a href="../KeysAndIndexes">key</a>, marked as unique, should have 0-1 matching rows. If there are more than 1 matching row, it's considered to be a rule violation.</td>
    </tr>
