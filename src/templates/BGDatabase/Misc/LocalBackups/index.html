<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>
    Local backups are not 100% robust way to avoid any risk of data loss, because they can not help in case of your hard drive failure.
    That's why we highly recommend to regularly backup or commit database file into your Version Control system to avoid possible data loss risks.
