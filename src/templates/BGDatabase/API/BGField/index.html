#set page=BGField API

<p>
    BGField.cs -is a table field, which has it's own type.  The API list is not full.
</p>
<p>
    Strictly speaking, each type has it's own field.
    For example, BGFieldInt.cs - is a field of type int, etc.
    However you do not have to know anything about these classes, all you need to know is field's type
