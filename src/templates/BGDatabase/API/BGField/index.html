#set page=BGField API

<p>
    BGField.cs -is a table field, which has it's own type.  The API list is not full.
</p>
<p>
    Strictly speaking, each type has it's own field.
    For example, BGFieldInt.cs - is a field of type int, etc.
    However you do not have to know anything about these classes, all you need to know is field's type

    <tr>
        <td>this[int entityIndex]</td>
        <td>T</td>
        <td>Get/Set value by entity index. This is the fastest method to get entity value. T means generic is used, so for int field- T meas int value, for long T means long etc.</td>

        <td colspan="3">
<pre class="nomargin"><code class="language-csharp">//get entity value by it's index (first entity)
var entityValue = field[0];
//set value
field[0] = entityValue;</code></pre>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>this[BGId entityId]</td>
        <td>T</td>
        <td>Get/Set value by entity id. This is much slower method, than getting value by entity Index. T means generic is used, so for int field- T meas int value, for long T means long etc.</td>

        <td colspan="3">
<pre class="nomargin"><code class="language-csharp">//get entity value by it's id
