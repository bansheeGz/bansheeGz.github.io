<h4>Save/Load settings</h4>
Let's look at the save/load setting to understand how they can be used to save/load your data during gameplay.

<h4>Using "Row level controller" to add new scenes after game release</h4>
<p>
    As you can see on the screenshot above, "Collectables" table has "Add missing" and "Removed orphaned" toggles turned on in the settings.
    It means, that after loading saved data with SaveLoad addon, all "Collectables" rows will be replaced with the saved rows.
    But what if we want to add new scenes with new collectables?
    These new collectables are missing in the saved data, but we do not want them to be removed after game loading.
</p>
<p>
    In such cases, a row controller can be used to prevent certain rows from removing.
    Below is in-depth guide how to achieve it.
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
       First of all we need to add "Version" table with a single row and single "version" int field to keep track of database version
       <div class="bg-image">
           <a href="../../../../images/BGDatabase/3dexample1.png"><img style="width: 200px; height: 100px" src="../../../../images/BGDatabase/3dexample1.png"></a>
       </div>
       and add this table to SaveLoad merge settings
       <div class="bg-image">
           <a href="../../../../images/BGDatabase/3dexample2.png"><img style="width: 200px; height: 100px" src="../../../../images/BGDatabase/3dexample2.png"></a>
       </div>
       Now, whenever you save the data, we can figure out which database version was used.
   </li>
    <li>
        Now let's say our game was already released, and now we want to add a new scene "BEExample3".
        We add a "version" int field to the "Scene" table.
        For existing scenes we keep the value=0, but for the new scene, we set the value to 1 (which means the scene was added to database version 1)
        We also set "Version.version" field value to 1.
        <div class="bg-image">
            <a href="../../../../images/BGDatabase/3dexample3.png"><img style="width: 200px; height: 100px" src="../../../../images/BGDatabase/3dexample3.png"></a>
        </div>
        The saved data has the "Version.version" value of 0 (or maybe the saved data does not contain "Version" table, in this case we also assume the version=0)
        and we can tell, that all "Collectables" rows, related to scenes with version > saved "Version.version" (which is currently equal to 0) should not be removed.
        This trick with increasing "Version.version" and adding new scenes with the new version will also work fine if you want to add new scenes in the future.
        So next time you want to add a new scene ("BEExample4") you can set "Version.version" to 2 and "BEExample4.version" to 2 etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Now we need to add a row controller, which compare the saved version with the current version
        and if the scene's current version > saved "Version.version" value,
        controller should prevent this scene's "Collectables" rows from removing.
        Controller class can be assigned via "Controller Type" field.
        <div class="bg-image">
            <a href="../../../../images/BGDatabase/3dexample4.png"><img style="width: 200px; height: 100px" src="../../../../images/BGDatabase/3dexample4.png"></a>
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>

<h5>How to see it in action</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Download the example project</li>
    <li>Run it with 2 scenes and save the game</li>
    <li>Add a new scene, add new Collectable rows to it, set "version" field to 1 for the new scene, change "Version.version" to 1</li>
    <li>Run with 3 scenes and load the game. Collectable rows for the new scene should be preserved</li>
</ol>
