<h4>General information</h4>
<p>
Machine translation allows to auto-translate string/text fields.
</p>
<p>
    Amazon Translate is also fully integrated and can translate from/to English and 10 different languages.
    But it can translate only if English language is set as source or target.
</p>
<p>
    IBM Watson is not recommended. It is also integrated but by default has very few translation language pairs and only has 1 month free subscription.
</p>
<p>
    Yandex is not recommended anymore, cause they removed free service usage
    (60 days free <a href="https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/free-trial/concepts/quickstart">trial</a> is still available).
    Currently we are evaluating all the consequences of this step
</p>
<p>
    Google Translate is not integrated (cause they do not have a free service) and available only via Google Sheets.
