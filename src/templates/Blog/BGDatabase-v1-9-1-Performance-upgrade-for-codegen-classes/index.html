<h4>Minor API changes</h4>
<p>
    Some APIs have been changed.
    We hope that very few people (if any) are affected by these changes.
    Fortunately, none of our plugins are affected (some of them need to be updated to work properly with new features).
    However, if you are using custom scripting with our API, you may encounter some breaking changes.
    Hereâ€™s how to fix them.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to version 1.2, each field and table had a single corresponding class, such as <code>BGFieldInt</code> for integer fields,  <code>BGMetaRow</code> for "row" tables etc.
    Now, some implementing classes may differ, and we have switched to using interfaces for these classes,
    for example, the interface for the integer fields is <code>BGFieldIntContract</code> and the interface for the "row" tables is <code>BGMetaRowContract</code> etc.
    A few method signatures have been updated to work with interfaces instead of classes.
    You can cast these interfaces to their corresponding base classes: <code>BGField</code> is the base class for all fields,
    and <code>BGMetaEntity</code> is the base class for all tables.
</p>
<p>
    If you encounter a compilation error related to the API change that you cannot resolve, please revert the database to version 1.8.19
    without saving the database with the new version and contact us.

<h4>New global search tool</h4>
<p>
    Search all database rows with the new 'Search Anywhere' tool.
