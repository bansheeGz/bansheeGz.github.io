#set description=Rotates the object to curve's tangent or custom rotation field, which are determined by Cursor position. It uses Quaternion.LookRotation method. It does not change the cursor itself, you need another component to change cursor position (like Cursor Change Linear)  If you are looking for a single component to move/rotate/scale some object, take a look at <a href="../BGCcTrs">TRS</a> component
