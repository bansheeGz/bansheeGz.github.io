paramName=splitMode
paramDescription=The mode for splitting a spline. #
1) PartsTotal - use specified number parts for whole spline. #
2) PartsPerSection - use specified number parts for each section (between 2 points)  #
3) UseMathData -use data, precalculated by Math component. Note, you can tweak some params at Math as well

paramName=doNotOptimizeStraightLines
paramDescription=Split straight lines. Straight lines are optimized by default and are not split, but you can override it with this parameter.

paramName=profileMode
paramDescription=Line or 2D spline

paramName=profileSpline
paramDescription=2D (XY) spline for Spline profile mode.

paramName=uCoordinateStart
paramDescription=U coordinate (normally between 0 and 1) to use at first point of profile line or spline.

paramName=uCoordinateEnd
paramDescription=U coordinate (normally between 0 and 1) to use at last point of profile line or spline.

paramName=swapUV
paramDescription=should we use U coordinate as V coordinate

paramName=swapNormals
paramDescription=reverse normals direction

paramName=vCoordinateScale
paramDescription=scale V coordinates (default is 1)

paramName=showHandles
paramDescription=This component supports handles in Scene View. Enable this flag to show handles. Handles are not interactive.

paramName=spheresScale
paramDescription=Adjust spheres scale. Each sphere represent one point of the polyline.

paramName=spheresColor
paramDescription=Set spheres color.

paramName=spheresCount
paramDescription=The number of first N points (spheres) to show. The number is restricted for performance reason.
