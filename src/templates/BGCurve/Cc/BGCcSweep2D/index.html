    <h4>How it works?</h4>
</div>
<div class="mdl-grid bg-feature mdl-shadow--2dp">
    <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--9-col mdl-cell--6-col-tablet mdl-cell--3-col-phone ">
        Cross spline is duplicated at each split point along the main spline. The direction is calculated as cross product of Up vector and spline's tangent

        This component has 2 very serious limitations:
        <ol>
            <li>1) Both splines should be in 2D mode</li>
            <li>2) At steep curves generated polygons may overlap (and mesh looks like broken)</li>
        </ol>
        Due to these limitations, this component has very limited use scenarios, but it still can be used as an example for building your own procedural meshes.
