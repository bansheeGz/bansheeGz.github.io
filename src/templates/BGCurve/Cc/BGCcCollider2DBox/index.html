#set description=Generates a set of 2D Box colliders along 2D spline. The spline should be in XY 2D mode. Also, there should not be any GameObject with 2D Box colliders immediately under the spline object, #
cause it's reusing them for it's own need. If by some reason you need some independent GameObject with 2D BoxCollider under the spline, place it under another object without BoxCollider.
