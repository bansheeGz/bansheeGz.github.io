paramName=fields
paramDescription=Which fields to calculate ('Position' Or 'Position With Tangent'). Position only is approximately 1.8x times faster, so if you do not need tangents, keep it PositionsOnly.

paramName=mathType
paramDescription=Type of spline's approximation. <br/>1) Base- split every section uniformly to N even parts. #
<br/>2) Adaptive- split every section non-uniformly based on spline's curvature. This can greatly reduce the number of required points. <br/>See more details in "For Programmers" section.

paramName=sectionParts
paramDescription=Number of parts to split every section of the spline for Base mathType (approximation). More parts- more precise approximation and lesser performance.

paramName=tolerance
paramDescription=parameter to control Adaptive mathType (approximation). Lesser this parameter- more points are created and lesser performance.

paramName=usePositionToCalculateTangents
paramDescription=Use points positions to calculate tangents instead of formula. You absolutely need this parameter if you use snapping.

paramName=optimizeStraightLines
paramDescription=Do not split straight lines and use 2 points for such sections. Tangents may behave differently in this mode.

paramName=updateMode
paramDescription=Updating math takes some time and resources. You can fine-tune in which cases math is updated (for the sake of performance). #
<br/>1) Always- always update then spline's changed<br/>#
2) AabbVisible- update only if AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box) around points and controls is visible by any camera (including Editor's SceneView camera)<br/>#
3) RendererVisible- update only if some renderer is visible <br/>#
4) ForceEveryFrame- update even if spline's not changed. You need this mode then you use Unity Animation (which changes private fields and no events are fired)

paramName=rendererForUpdateCheck
paramDescription=Renderer for RendererVisible update mode. Any Game Object with some Renderer attached. Math will be updated only if this object is visible by any camera (including Editor's SceneView camera).

paramName=mathChanged
paramDescription=This is a standard Unity persistent event to be fired then math is recalculated. Math is recalculated then spline's changed. It's defined as mathChanged()

paramName=showHandles
paramDescription=This component supports handles in Scene View. Enable this flag to show handles. Handles are not interactive.

paramName=spheresScale
paramDescription=Adjust spheres scale. Each sphere represent point, calculated during spline's approximation.

paramName=spheresColor
paramDescription=Set spheres color.

paramName=spheresCount
paramDescription=The number of first N points (spheres) to show. The number is restricted for performance reason.
