#set description=Generates a set of Box colliders along the spline. Also, there should not be any GameObject with Box colliders immediately under the spline object, #
cause it's reusing them for it's own need. If by some reason you need some independent GameObject with BoxCollider under the spline, place it under another object without BoxCollider.
