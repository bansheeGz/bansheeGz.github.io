#set description=Generates a set of <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-BoxCollider.html">Box colliders</a> along the spline. There should not be any GameObject with Box colliders right under the spline object, cause it's reusing them for it's own need. If by some reason you need some independent GameObject with BoxCollider under the spline, place it under another object without BoxCollider.
