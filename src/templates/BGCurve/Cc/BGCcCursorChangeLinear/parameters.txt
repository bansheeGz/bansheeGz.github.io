paramName=speedField
paramDescription=Custom field to get values for speed (for example speed from point 0 is active between point0 and point1 etc.). #
It should be a float field. Final speed is determined as speed*Time.deltaTime.

paramName=speed
paramDescription=Speed for moving cursor. Final speed is determined as speed*Time.deltaTime. This parameter is active only if speedField is not set.

paramName=delayField
paramDescription=Custom field to get values for delays (for example delay at point 0 occurs then cursor reaches point0 etc.). It should be a float field. It works correctly only if spline is not changing.

paramName=delay
paramDescription=Delay to occur then cursor reaches some point. This parameter is active only if delayField is not set.

paramName=overflowControl
paramDescription=Action, taken then cursor overflows spline's length. #
<br/>Cycle - cursor moves to opposite end and start moving with the same speed. #
<br/>PingPong - speed changes to opposite and cursor starts moving back with the same speed.#
<br/>Stop - speed is set to zero.

paramName=adjustByTotalLength
paramDescription=If spline's length changed, cursor position be adjusted with spline's length to ensure visually constant speed along the spline. #
You may need this if you are constantly changing the spline slightly.

paramName=pointPassed
paramDescription=This is a standard Unity persistent event to be fired then cursor reaches some point. It's defined as pointPassed(int pointIndex). It works correctly only if spline is not changing.
