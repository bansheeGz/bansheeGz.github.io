#set description=Generates a set of <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-CapsuleCollider.html">Capsule colliders</a> along the spline. <span style="color: red" >Note, there should not be any GameObject with Capsule colliders right under the spline object, cause it's reusing them for it's own need. If by some reason you need some independent GameObject with CapsuleCollider under the spline, place it under another object without CapsuleCollider.</span>
